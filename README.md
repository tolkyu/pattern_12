Develop a program for scoring for participation in biathlon competitions. Scoring rules are different for men, women and kids: Men: For each hit in the target is awarded 100 points. 5 points are deducted for each second spent on the race. Women: For each hit in the target is awarded 100 points. 4 points are deducted for each second spent on the race. Kids: For each hit in the target is charged 200 points. 2 points are deducted for each second spent on the race. If the result is negative, the resulting sum of points is assumed to be 0.
